### Resource Types

#### Resource Type Modules

The supported resource types by Azure Resource Inventory are defined by the "Resource Type Modules", we made sure to create this structure to be as simple as possible. 

So anyone could contribute by creating new modules for new resource types.

There is a Resource Type Module file for every single resource type supported by ARI, the structure of resource type module itself is explained in the "Module-template.tpl", located in Modules/Public/InventoryModules.

Once you create the module file, it must be placed in the correct folder structure under Modules/Public/InventoryModules. The subfolder structure follows the official Azure documentation for Resource Providers: [azure-services-resource-providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers)
